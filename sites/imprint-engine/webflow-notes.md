.home-gradient-wrap
  .home-gradient

      [home-gradient-svg]
        [home-gradient-orbit]
          [home-gradient-piece="1"] to [home-gradient-piece="8"]

        [ripple-ring] x3

Gradient SVG and CSS live in .home-gradient-embed.
Gradient scroll animation lives in homeAnimation(). The eight SVG pieces form the
bottom gradient, split into a rotating ring, then become three drops that merge.
The final drop landing triggers the preserved elliptical ripple animation. The
ripple plays on its own timeline and is not tied to scroll scrub.
